    <h1> About me </h1>
    <p>Welcome to my "About me" page!</p>
    <br>
    <p>
        My name is William Jensen and I am 18 years-old, being born and raised in Utah. In May 2020, I graduated from Utah County Academy of Sciences with my high school diploma 
        and Utah Valley University with my Associate of Science in University Studies. Attending the university gave me the opportunity to take multiple Computer Sciences that introduced me to the field. 
        My love for programming started when I was a little kid having my dad work from home. Since then, two of my brothers have gone into Software Engineering while the other two work as Lab Support Technicians.

        I first heard of Lambda School from my brother. Since I just graduated high school and didn't quite know what to do with my life other than being a programmer, I decided to enroll.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        I am currently working as a Stocker/Backroom Associate at Walmart working part-time. Working part-time gives me more time to focus on the materials covered in Lambda School and helps me ensure myself that I master all the concepts.
